      <span class="description hidden" for="careerDevelopment">
        <p>The Career Development directorship aims to enhance SWE members'
          skills in their career path by guiding them through various events,
          such as the <b>Professional Networking Dinner</b>, etiquette lunch, and
          industry panels. They also connect SWE to corporations and build
          strong relationships between the students and companies. Career
          Development's goal is to shape SWE members and guide them in finding
          for a career.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Communications</p>
        <div class="description">
          <p>The Communications directorship seeks to spread SWE's name on the
            campus by publicizing events through various means, such as postering,
            sending electronic mailings weekly to inform members of future events,
            designing and maintaining the website, etc. The goal is to keep students
            informed on upcoming SWE activities and opportunities through SWE.</p>
          <p>The Communications directorship also includes Faculty Relations and
            Alumni Relations. The Faculty Relations branch connects students and
            faculty through various social events, allowing SWE members to network
            and get to know their professors. Faculty Relations hosts the
            Student-Faculty Dinner, an intimate gathering where students have the
            opportunity to meet engineering career services and faculty from every
            engineering discipline. Alumni Relations connects Cornell SWE alumni with
            current members through various programs and events.</p>
          <p>We also create and distribute the annual SWE Magazine, which highlights
            SWE members and events, as well as Cornell professors. The SWE Magazine
            is a way to celebrate all that SWE has accomplished every year, and the
            hard work our members have put in to support women in engineering!</p>

    <div>
      <p>Conference</p>
        <div class="description">
          <p>The Conference Directorship is responsible for the planning,
            registration, and coordination of all logistics related to the SWE
            National Conference and any regional conferences that Cornell SWE may
            attend. This includes booking hotels, booking airfare, booking ground
            transportation from airports to various locations, and ensuring all
            members are registered correctly for the conference. Responsibilities
            also include organizing a local alumni event during the national
            conference to connect students with alumni.</p>
          <p>This directorship has two directors who have typically been on SWE
            E-board for at least a year, unless in special circumstances in which a
            SWE Chair has been to conference(s). The Conference directorship works
            closely with Finance and the rest of the executive board to make the
            travel process as smooth as possible and to ensure that every attendee
            at a conference has a fulfilling experience in professional development
            and learning about how to improve the Cornell section of SWE</p>

      <p>Corporate Relations</p>
        <div class="description">
          <p>The Cornell Society of Women Engineers Corporate Relations directorship
            plans, coordinates, and advertises interactive sessions for Cornell
            Engineering students to meet with prospective employers.</p>
          <p>Through these events, we increase students access to networking and
            professional development opportunities. We aim to provide students with
            opportunities to meet company representatives in an informal setting and
            assist students in learning about the company to ease both the
            interviewing and job decision making process.</p>
          <p>Sponsors will receive exclusive access to the SWE network and resume
            book. Through information sessions and events, companies have the
            opportunity to increase on-campus recognition and recruit students for
            permanent and internship positions. These sessions are open to all
            students on campus.</p>

      <p>Finance</p>
        <div class="description">
          <p>The Finance directorship is in charge of all the financing within SWE.
            This includes all the money transactions from SWE events, ranging from
            information sessions, national and regional conferences, outreach/community
            service events, and many others.</p>
          <p>The Finance Directorship works closely with Diversity Programs in
            Engineering at Cornell and the Cornell Finance Department to ensure swift
            transactions. We strive to provide easy payments and billing, and work to
            ensure that your financial experience with the Society of Women Engineers
            is smooth and rewarding.</p>

      <p>Fundraising</p>
        <div class="description">
          <p>The Fundraising Directorship is responsible for raising money to send
            our members to the annual SWE National Conference and to help support the
            many other events on campus that our organization hosts. This directorship
            focuses primarily on obtaining sponsorships from various companies by
            putting together a fundraising proposal to distribute to corporate
            contacts. Additionally, we host smaller events throughout the year such
            as Chipotle fundraisers to involve the entire Cornell community in support
            and awareness of our section.</p>

      <p>Student Services</p>
        <div class="description">
          <p>SWE Student Services works to build a strong SWE community to provide
            members with necessary resources to succeed during their time at Cornell.
            We organize monthly general body meetings during which members network
            with one another and are informed of upcoming SWE and general on-campus
            events. Furthermore, we look to grow membership by tabling at ClubFest
            and hosting a Welcome Picnic early in the fall semester.</p>
          <p>Our internal mentorship program matches underclassmen to upperclassmen
            with similar interests and major course of study. This allows for
            upperclassmen to share their experiences and provide advice to help
            facilitate their mentees’ transition to college while fostering
            interconnectivity.</p>
          <p>Social events throughout the year include Halloween-themed apple cider
            and leaf painting, movie outings, cookie decorating, and an annual
            Escape Room charity fundraiser.</p>

      <p>Outreach</p>
        <div class="description">
          <p>SWE Outreach strives to bring STEM education and awareness to individuals
            of all ages throughout Cornell and the greater Ithaca community. By
            partnering with groups within the community, we hope to influence a diverse
            audience of young people, parents, teachers, and mentors to pique and
            sustain their interest in STEM. On campus, we strive to attain a college-wide
            awareness of the challenges underrepresented minorities face in STEM, taking
            steps toward racial and gender parity by leveraging connections with other
            Diversity Programs in Engineering.</p>
          <p>In the past we have partnered with Girl Scouts of NYPENN, Ithaca High
            School Code Red Robotics, Tompkins County Public Library, Junior FLL, SWE
            NEXT clubs, and many others. We are always looking for more partnership
            opportunities!</p>
          <p>We are also involved with the recruitment of incoming women engineers
            to the College of Engineering at Cornell. Every year we run Women in
            Engineering Day for accepted students. The goal of this program is to
            expose prospective women to the opportunities at Cornell and the
            influence and strength of our section of SWE.</p>
