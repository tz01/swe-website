        <p> Held the evening before Cornell's technical career fair, the Professional Networking
          Dinner enables company representatives and students to interact in an intimate
          yet relaxed environment. Representatives can share personal and
          business experiences while seeing first-hand just what Cornell has to offer.
          Students can speak to representatives for an extended
          period of time and learn more about the workplace environment of many top
          engineering companies. </p>

      <p>Tickets are $15 and may be purchased online with a credit card. The
        dinner consists of a four course meal catered by The Statler, with
        four rotations, during which you will be able to network with
        different companies in a relaxed environment. Additionally, there
        will be a short networking session prior to the start of the official
        rotations, and a thirty minute networking session at the end of the
        night so that you will have the opportunity to speak to any
        representatives that you may have missed, or would like to talk to
        again. This is a great way to meet company reps and find a summer
        internship, co-op, or full time job.</p>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-companies" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-companies-tab">
      <p>The event will cost $200.00 for the first company representative and
        $180.00 for each additional representative. Please note that each
        company is limited to a maximum of 4 company representatives.
        Companies may also choose to purchase an advertisement to be included
        in the program. Half page ads (5"x4") cost $50 and full page ads
        (5"x 8") cost $70.</p>
      <p>Dinner and four networking rotations will allow you to meet a wide
        variety of students in a casual and friendly atmosphere.
        Representatives are invited to stay an additional half hour, until
        10:00pm, for further networking. This is a wonderful opportunity to
        get to know potential full-time and internship applicants prior to
        the career fair.</p>
