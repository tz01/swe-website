    <p id="text"> Classes officially end at 4:25pm each day. Career Services would like to
      standardize session times, and so we will be offering sessions at 4:30pm, 6:00pm
      , and 7:30pm. For engineers, Tuesday and Thursday evenings are preliminary
      (midterm) exam nights. To avoid possible conflicts, please see the fall
      preliminary exam schedule or fall final exam schedule. Exams for the
      following courses are large lectures and tend to be busy times for
      engineers: MATH 1910, 1920, 2930, 2940, PHYS 1112, 2213, 2214, CHEM 2090,
      CS courses, ENGRD courses, and ENGRI courses. </p>

    <!-- <h3> How do I gauge the anticipated attendance at a session? </h3>
    <p> Although we can provide you with a number, we feel that it is better for
      companies to anticipate their attendance as you will know best what your
      turnout would be. The average number of students is typically 30. The base
      prices for the refreshment options are determined by this average number. </p>

    <h3> When is the latest I can cancel? </h3>
    <p> One week prior notice to SWE Corporate Relations Directors
      (cornell.swe.cr@gmail.com) is required for cancellations.
      Cancellations made 7 days or less than the date of the session will
      result in a charge of half of the base price of a session. Less than 24
      hours notice will result in a charge for the full price of the session.
      If you cancel at least 7 days prior to your scheduled info session,
      you will be fully refunded. </p>

    <h3> Why did my room reservation change from what was confirmed?</h3>
    <p> Professors who make requests for academic purposes have priority
      over any other type of reservation. If such an event happens, we will
      find the next available location in closest proximity to the original
      reservation. We will send out emails and announcements to students about
      the location change. Additionally, we will post signs and have a
      liaison to redirect students to your new session location the day of your
      session. </p>

    <h3> Can I opt to have a closed session for selected interviewees only?</h3>
    <p> Yes, you can choose to not advertise your session to the general campus
      community. We will notify Engineering Career Services of your request and
      they will notify only the list of interviewees.</p>

    <h3> When is payment due?</h3>
    <p> Payment is due one to two weeks after an info session. </p>

    <h3> How do I pay?</h3>
    <p> We will send you a payment link and invoice. For tax and federal ID,
      please email us at cornell.swe.cr@gmail.com.
    </p>

    <h3> How soon can I expect a confirmation after I submit my request?
    </h3>
    <p> Within a week. We will work on getting your request processed as soon
      as possible. Turnaround time can be as early as 24 hours.
    </p>

    <h3> When is the latest I can request to coordinate an information session with SWE?
    </h3>
    <p> In order for SWE to provide the highest quality service, all session
      details must be finalized at least one week prior to the desired date.
      Ordering food and reserving a room is never a problem, however, it does
      take one week for room requests to be processed and confirmed. At least a
      week is necessary to properly publicize an information session and ensure
      the session has sufficient number of liaisons and volunteers. Since session
      details may take several days to finalize - especially if you have
      any questions about the session options - we recommend that session requests
      are made at least 14 days prior to the desired date.
    </p>
