        <p>Held the evening before Cornell's technical career fair, the Professional
          Networking Dinner enables company representatives and students to interact
          in an intimate yet relaxed environment.  Students have the opportunity to
          speak to representatives and learn more about their work, while
          representatives have the opportunity to share their experience and see
          first-hand just what Cornell has to offer. Please contact Rema Toopal and
          Angela Melugin at cornellswe.pnd@gmail.com if you have any questions.</p>

        <p>Tickets are $15 and may be purchased online with a credit card. The
          dinner consists of a four course meal catered by The Statler, with
          four rotations, during which you will be able to network with
          different companies in a relaxed environment. Additionally, there
          will be a short networking session prior to the start of the official
          rotations, and a thirty minute networking session at the end of the
          night so that you will have the opportunity to speak to any
          representatives that you may have missed, or would like to talk to
          again. This is a great way to meet company reps and find a summer
          internship, co-op, or full time job.</p>

        <p>Company Representatives</p>
        <p>The event will cost $200.00 for the first company representative and
          $180.00 for each additional representative. Please note that each
          company is limited to a maximum of 4 company representatives.
          Companies may also choose to purchase an advertisement to be included
          in the program. Half page ads (5"x4") cost $50 and full page ads
          (5"x 8") cost $70.</p>
        <p>Dinner and four networking rotations will allow you to meet a wide
          variety of students in a casual and friendly atmosphere.
          Representatives are invited to stay an additional half hour, until
          10:00pm, for further networking. This is a wonderful opportunity to
          get to know potential full-time and internship applicants prior to
          the career fair.</p>
